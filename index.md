# Welcome to My Humble Corner of the Web! 🤘🏻😊

Hi there! My name is **Zoli**, though online I'm often known as **Gildrom**. 
I’m a passionate *writer* and *researcher*. <br>
I'm also a dedicated collector — some might even say a *hoarder*.

I have a deep love for collecting just about anything. <br>
(My room is packed to the ceiling with more books than what I could ever read in a lifetime.)

My online habits are not dissimilar. <br>
On this site, I’m curating and (slowly) organising a backlog of ~~useless~~ *insightful* resources about the **Craft of Writing**.

Feel free to explore and enjoy! 🕳️🕵🏻‍♂️
